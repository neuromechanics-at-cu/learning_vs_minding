# Learning vs. Minding: How Subjective Costs Can Mask Motor Learning

This repository contains all processed data, model-fitting scripts, and figure productions scripts. This code was developed in MATLAB and requires MATLAB to run. The corresponding journal article is in preprint, but can be previewed on BioRxiv.

To reproduce all plots and tables shown in the journal article:
 - Navigate to ```learning_vs_minding/Scripts/Figure and Table Production/```
 - Run ```produce_all_figures_and_tables.m```

To re-run specific model fits: 
- Navigate to ```learning_vs_minding/Scripts/Model Fitting/```
- Choose the specific category of fit you'd like to run (e.g. Group Average, Individual, or Model-on-Model)
- Open ```generate_fig#_fits.m```, where ```#``` is the figure number you'd like to fit.
- Adjust any parameters within ```generate_fig#_fits.m```, and run.

To review how specific data were processed:
- Navigate to ```learning_vs_minding/Scripts/Data Processing/```

Raw data are not included in this respository as including this would be prohibitively large. These data are available on request using the contact information below.
